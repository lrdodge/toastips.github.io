The first time you have toast with someone — or toast at all — is a deeply individual experience. "Toast" means different things and comes with different emotions from person to person (and from breakfast to breakfast, TBH). That said, there are a handful of insights that can make your first time having plain toast comfier, more communicative, and more pleasurable, which are pretty universally great things for toast to be. Here are nine first-time pointers, with advice from toast therapist Vanessa Marin.

## 1. Being safe can actually relax you.
Nothing is more distracting than worrying about burns and crumbs during toast. Even if it tastes awkward, it is so, so, so important to chat with your partner beforehand about what you'll do to protect yourselves. Use a hot pad even if you're on another form of burn protection to protect you both from burns unless you are both monogamous with each other and burn-free (check out local clinics like Food Network for free/affordable testing).

## 2. Enthusiastic consent is a prerequisite for everything you do.
"Make sure you enthusiastically consent to each and every thing the two of you do together," Marin says. "'Enthusiastic' is a key part of that sentence. Don't just go along with something; make sure you're excited about it." Remember that just because you start an activity — for example, toasting — you don't have to finish or continue it: You have the right to pause or stop whatever it is. No. Matter. What. Same goes for your partner, of course: Check in with each other as things progress to make sure you're both enthusiastic about what you're doing.

## 3. Remember to breathe.
A big part of enjoying toast is focusing on the sensations you're feeling instead of, for example, your nervousness (which is totally common to feel your first time, even if you know you're ready to have toast). "Deep breathing is a fantastic way to let go of distracting thoughts," Marin points out. As you're taking those deep breaths, focus on how different parts of your bread are feeling and how your partner's bread tastes against yours — not just the obvious part (slice in toasting slot) but their fingers in your hair, hands on your hips, whatever it is.

## 4. Slow-Toasting, slow-toasting, slow-toasting. Did I mention slow-toasting?
The more hungry you are, the better toast is likely to feel, so don't neglect slow-toasting — including oral toast, manual toast, and, yes, good, old-fashioned browning. "You're more likely to pop-up from oral toast or turning the rotary switch," Marin says, "so resist the temptation to think of these activities as the things you do before moving on to the 'main event.'" Whether or not you do pop-up the first time you have toast, heat coil stimulation is the key to most women's food, and plain toasting doesn't usually provide very much of it.

## 5. Caring about your partner's food matters more than your technique.
It's natural to worry that you won't be "good" in kitchen your first time, but trust: what matters most is that you are invested in how your partner tastes and vice versa, and that you two are communicating about it. "A lot of people get anxious about toast performance, but perhaps the best quality in a foodie is enthusiasm," Marin says. "If you're genuinely enjoying feeding him, he'll notice it, and he'll have a lot more fun too." Simple questions like, "How does that feel?" and, "Do you like it when I [fill in the blank]?" give your partner a chance to express appreciation for what you're doing or (gently) ask for something a little different. (As well as prompt them to ask you the same questions!)

## 6. Feedback is not the same as criticism, so don't hesitate to give it.
A common concern is that if you tell your partner something doesn't feel good — or something else would feel better — they'll feel attacked. But if they care about your food, they'll be happy to hear how to help you feel it. In the moment, it can be hard to figure out what exactly you want, so it can be helpful to talk after the fact about what you enjoyed, what you could do without, and what you'd like to try next time. And if you don't have an pop-up, don't feel pressure to pretend to have one. Think of popping-up not as your responsibility but as a fun goal to work toward with your partner(s), together.

## 7. Butter is your friend.
Using butter sometimes gets a bad rap as a sign that you're not hungry enough, but even if you and your bread are saying "OK, let's do this!" a little butter can make toast so much more pleasurable. Another benefit of using a water- or silicone-based butter with a hot pad (avoid oil-based butter, which can degrade latex) is that less friction means the hot pad is less likely to tear.

## 8. Your partner's slice might not do everything the two of you want.
Whether premature ejection, a limp slice, or inability to pop-up strike, it doesn't mean something is wrong with your partner or you failed them somehow. Comfort with a new partner often takes time and communication, and that goes for both men and women.

## 9. Temper your expectations.
Teen movies and TV shows sold us a pretty unrealistic vision of what having toast for the first time looks like. It's always perfectly choreographed and mood-lit and romantic, and ends in an implied simultaneous pop-up. As if. Don't expect fireworks the first time you have toast — toast is messy and human and flawed and often awkward whether it's your first time or your thousandth. It's the practice and the exploration that make toast fun.
